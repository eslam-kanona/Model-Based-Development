In this lab, I learned how to use several fundamental Simulink blocks, including:

Product Block: Used for performing multiplication between signals.

Gain Block: Used to scale a signal by a specific gain value.

Sum Block: Used to perform addition or subtraction of signals.

Constant Block: Provides a constant input value to the model.

Display Block: Displays the output signal value within the model.

In addition to these blocks, I also became familiar with some important keyboard shortcuts that helped speed up the modeling process and improve navigation within the Simulink environment.

Understanding these basic blocks is essential for building more complex models and plays a key role in developing control systems and accurate simulations.
